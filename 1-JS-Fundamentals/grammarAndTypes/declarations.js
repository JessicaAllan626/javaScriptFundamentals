let a = 2;

let     b = 1;
//1     2 3 4

/* 
1 => Js keyword to denote the creation of a variable
2 => The name of the variable 
3 => The assignment operator, initializes the variable
4 => The initial value we give to the variable
*/

//! variable declaration
//* The declaration is to the left of the assigment operator
//* This is where the variable is created  by using a designated a JS keyword (let, var, const, and others)

//! variable initialization
//* The initialization is to the right side of the assignment operator
//* This is where the developer sets the value for the declared variable

//? More examples:

let x;
//* example of variable declration without the initialization

x = 10;
//* later on you would initialize the initial declaration by providing the value for the variable
