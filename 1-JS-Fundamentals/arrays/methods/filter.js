  /*
  1 => Create an Array of objects called foods
  
  2 => Each object has a name and a price
  
  3 => Made a variable(which is another array) that will hold the objects we filtered out
  
  ? 4 => On our foods array, we tack on the .filter array-method
  ? that method will loop/iterate over the array and apply the conditions we state 
  
  ! 5 => We pass in a function that will take in an object from our array
  ! (in this case, we called it food, it can be named whatever you want. Just don't confuse yourself)
  
  ! 6 => We tell the function to 'step into' the object and look at the price
  ! and if the price is less than or equal to 100
  ! return it to the filteredPrice Array
  
  ? 7 => This is showing that you can tack on other methods to filter by 
  ? It's saying that if the name of the food starts with 'b'
  ? Then return it to the filteredName array
