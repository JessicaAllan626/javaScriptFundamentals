//! The .reduce method is a bit more confusing than the others, but incredibly useful!
//! It executes a function for each specified value in an array and returns a single value

const foods = [
    { name: "bread", price: 100 },
    { name: "beef", price: 200 },
    { name: "mint", price: 10 },
    { name: "shrimp", price: 5 },
    { name: "ketchup", price: 500 },
    { name: "bell pepper", price: 25 },
  ];
  
  //? So normally, if you wanted to get the total price of all of the food objects in this array,
  //? you would run a loop that adds the price every single time, then return the price
  //? The reduce method simplifies that
  
                              //1
  const total = foods.reduce((currentTotal, food) => {
      //2
    return food.price + currentTotal;
  //3
  }, 0);
  
  console.log(total);
  
  /*
  ! 1 => This method takes int two parameters. 
  ! The first will be the current sum of the numbers at each iteration.
  ! The second will be what we are item we are iterating over
  
  ! 2 => So we will look at the price of food object, then add it to the current total
  ! Then do it over and over again until it has gone through each item in the array
  We should get 840
  
  ? 3 => The 0 at the end specifies what value we are going to start at. 
  ? So if we put 200, the total would come out to 1040
